## 📋 Introduction
In this project, you'll learn how to perform essential statistical calculations in Python using the powerful NumPy and SciPy libraries. This project aims to provide a solid foundation in statistics for data science, covering basic concepts and computations.

## 🔍 Dataset
The dataset used in this project is `weight-height.csv`, which contains the following attributes:
- **Height**: The height of individuals
- **Weight**: The weight of individuals

This dataset will be used to perform various statistical calculations, including measures of central tendency, dispersion, and correlation.

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/statistics-for-data-science.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```sh
    cd statistics-for-data-science
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## 🚀 Usage

1. **Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed** (see Installation section).

2. **Place the `weight-height.csv` file in the project directory**.

3. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook "Fundamentals of statistics for data science.ipynb"
    ```
